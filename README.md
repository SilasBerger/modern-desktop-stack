A playground for trying out and learning technologies that might be a good fit for a modern, high-performance desktop application technology stack. 

## ü•û The Stack
- UI framework: Electorn
- UI technologies: Web Components, Stencil.js
- UI language: TypeScript
- Core application technologies: Rust, WASM

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
I am getting a first, high-level overview of some of these technologies. This means that not all my notes and comments will be accurate or complete. Also, I don't yet know whether these technologies even fit together to form a reasonable stack for desktop application development, which is why I consider this only a playground.
