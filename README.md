A playground for trying out and learning technologies that might be a good fit for a modern desktop application technology stack. 

**Note:** I am having a first (potentially brief) look at some of these technologies. This means that not all my notes and comments will be accurate or complete. Also, I don't yet know whether these technologies even fit together to form a reasonable stack for desktop application development, which is why I consider this only a playground.
